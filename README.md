# HOW MANY PEOPLE PAID ETHER TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE PAID ETHER

A simple project I made to test my knowledge of React and Smart Contracts.

### The Contract

The contract is simple, it stores a map, and when someone pays, it add that address and increases a counter. 
When the method asking how many people paid is invoked, if the address is in the map, it returns the amount of people 
that payed.

### The App

The app is the most minimalistic I could make it. I only imported *react-awesome-modals* and *gh-pages*. 
Everything else is hand made.
